# Introduction
As part of the 5100 module we have to create an online multiplayer game using the NekoEngine game engine, internal game engine at the SAE Institute Geneva school. This game must include at least one playable level and an interface for connecting at least two players.

# Pitch
The game PongSoso is a reproduction of the game Pong imagined by Nolan Bushnell and developed by Allan Alcorn in 1972. This game is inspired by table tennis in top view.

# Mechanics

## Paddle
Two players compete against each other by moving the racket vertically represented by a red or blue line to hit the ball.
There are limitations at the top and bottom of the screen so that the paddle cannot exit the screen from its ends.
## Ball
There are limitations at the top and bottom of the screen so that the ball cannot exit the screen from its ends.

## End of the game
**The goal** is for each player to lose the **11 lives of the opponent**; lives that are lost when one player fails to return the ball to the other. A life score is displayed for the current game.
