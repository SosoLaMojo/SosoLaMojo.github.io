# Introduction
As part of the 5100 module we have to create an online multiplayer game using the NekoEngine game engine, internal game engine at the SAE Institute Geneva school. This game must include at least one playable level and an interface for connecting at least two players.

# Pitch
The game PongSoso is a reproduction of the game Pong imagined by Nolan Bushnell and developed by Allan Alcorn in 1972. This game is inspired by table tennis in top view.

Two players compete by moving the paddle vertically represented by a red or blue line to hit the ball. **The goal** is that each player reaches the score of **11 points before the opponent**; points that are earned when one player fails to return the ball to the other. A score is displayed for the current game. Walls are present at the top and bottom of the screen so that the ball cannot come out of the screen by its ends.
