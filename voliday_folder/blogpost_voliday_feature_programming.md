## Accessibility zone

During the development of this game, one of the tasks I was given was to create an accessibility zone for residential buildings (inns and castles).
Each residential building has an accessibility zone to allow AI to access other buildings (restaurants, activities and shops). If a business is not in the accessibility zone of a house, it will not be accessible by AI.
There are two types of dwellings, an inn for the poor AI and a castle for the rich AI. Each of these have their own types of business, commercial and restaurant buildings. Their code for their accessibility zone works the same way, the only change is the list of buildings that are eligible.
Each dwelling contains a list of buildings that are within its range (BuildingsInRange).
