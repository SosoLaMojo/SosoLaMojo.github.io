# Voliday Game Design Post-mortem

During the specialisation project of the Games Programming section in the Bachelor year at the SAE Institute in Geneva, we were asked to work on a video game project in group and in collaboration with the other sections of the school (game art and audio). The specialization module consists in having a precise role in the elaboration of our group project, my role was lead Game Designer.

We were asked to create a city builder on the Unreal Engine with the DA of Link's Awakening. This project lasted 8 months.

Elevator pitch:
Voliday is a city builder set on a volcanic island paradise. The objective is to make the island prosper by building unique buildings and tourist activities while exploiting the volcano's resources.

Below you can find the link to the itch page of our game:

As lead Game Designer, I had to set up the game world and gameplay by writing a Game Design Document very quickly to allow the rest of the team to start working on the project. To do this, I played several management games on different themes to get inspiration and establish the different mechanics of our game.

Inspirations:
